=head1 NAME

MyAppDB::BookAuthor - A model object representing the JOIN between an author
and
a book.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an object that represents a row in the ’book_authors’ table of your
application database. It uses DBIx::Class (aka, DBIC) to do ORM.
You probably won’t need to use this class directly -- it will be automatically
used by DBIC where joins are needed.
For Catalyst, this is designed to be used through MyApp::Model::MyAppDB.
Offline utilities may wish to use this class directly.
